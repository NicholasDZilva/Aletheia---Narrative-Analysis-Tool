Aletheia
Aletheia is a rule-based analytical framework for detecting institutional, corporate, and behavioural influence patterns in narrative systems.
Overview
Aletheia is a transparent, explainable framework designed to identify structural influence mechanisms in public narratives.
Rather than evaluating the truth or falsity of claims, Aletheia focuses on how narratives are shaped, which incentives are embedded, and where information asymmetries arise.
The framework operates through explicit pattern libraries and deterministic rules, enabling auditable, reproducible analysis without reliance on machine learning or opaque models.
Aletheia is intended as a research and diagnostic tool for studying influence, messaging asymmetry, and narrative control across institutional, corporate, and behavioural contexts.
Core Principles
Aletheia is built on four foundational principles:
Transparency over persuasion
The framework exposes mechanisms of influence rather than attempting to persuade or instruct.
Explainability by design
All detections are rule-based and traceable. There are no hidden weights, probabilistic scores, or black-box decisions.
Structural analysis, not moral judgment
Aletheia identifies patterns of influence and incentive alignment without assigning intent, legitimacy, or ethical evaluation.
Auditability and reproducibility
Results can be independently verified, contested, or extended by modifying explicit pattern definitions.
What Aletheia Does
Aletheia analyses narrative inputs to identify:
Institutional influence patterns
e.g. paradoxes where transparency, consent, or scrutiny are framed as threats
Corporate and NGO co-option signals
e.g. values-based branding aligned with extractive or profit-driven incentives
Behavioural influence mechanisms
e.g. nudging, framing effects, default manipulation, or social pressure engineering
Narrative asymmetry indicators
e.g. unequal power between message originators and audiences, or constrained choice architectures
The output is a structural diagnostic, not a verdict.
What Aletheia Does Not Do
To avoid misuse or misinterpretation, Aletheia explicitly does not:
Determine whether a narrative is true or false
Classify actors as “good” or “bad”
Predict behaviour or outcomes
Replace human judgment or contextual analysis
Perform sentiment analysis or ideological scoring
Aletheia is a lens, not a conclusion engine.
Architecture
The framework consists of:
Explicit pattern libraries
Curated sets of institutional, corporate, and behavioural influence patterns
Rule-based detection logic
Deterministic matching and structural inference
Counterfactual explanations
Contextual interpretations explaining why a pattern was flagged
Audit trail outputs
Designed to support review, critique, and extension
The reference implementation uses only the Python standard library to maximise portability and inspectability.
Intended Use Cases
Aletheia may be useful for:
Academic research in political communication, media studies, or governance
Investigative journalism and long-form analysis
Media literacy and education
Policy analysis and institutional review
Comparative narrative studies across domains
The framework is designed to support analysis and understanding, not enforcement or censorship.
Limitations
Aletheia operates within defined pattern sets and does not claim completeness or objectivity.
All outputs are contingent on:
The scope of the pattern libraries
The quality of input narratives
The interpretive context applied by the user
Disagreement with outputs should be addressed by refining patterns, not disputing the existence of analysis.
